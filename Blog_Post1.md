#cd Command

##cd no arguments
//put image here
When provided no arguments, the command changes the directory to the parent directory of the local device. In my case, I was in the lecture1 directory and was brought back to the parent directory of my device when running the command.

##cd with path to directory
//put image here
When provided a directory, it changes the working directory to the specified argument provided. However, this command only works if the argument is a child directory to the current working directory. If the current working directory is a child directory and the argument is a parent directory, it outputs an error. 
##cd with path to file
//put image here
When provided a file, it outputs an error. This is because files such as Hello.java is not a working directory but rather a file with contents to be read.
